Hello, my name is Jay.
I am a fullstack developer


I am studying to become a front end and back end web developer. Currently studying in the fullstack program bootcamp at Thinkful.
I am enjoying coding currently and learning many new things about programming. Creating a useful project that makes my quality of life a little better makes my day.

Other than coding, my other hobbies include cooking, playing table top games, and watching other people streaming themselves playing videogames or daily life.
